    "Note": "This version of the machine-readable comparison report is not definitive. The format is under discussion within the CCRI and CIPM to best reflect the requirements of ionizing radiation metrology and to conform to the SI digital framework. Users can use this document to analyse key comparison data and metadata more efficiently with their software. However, users should bear in mind that the format will necessarily evolve in subsequent updates of this key comparison, which will not guarantee the long-term compatibility of their interface. ",
