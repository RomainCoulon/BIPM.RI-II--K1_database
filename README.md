# BIPM key comparison database for radionuclide metrology

Romain Coulon, BIPM, 2022-10-03

This repository contains machine-readable versions (XML and JSON formats) of the BIPM/RI(II)-K1 key comparison reports [1].
These comparisons are made using the BIPM's measurement service, the International Reference System (SIR), which has been in use since 1976 [2].
The files contain exactly the same information as the reports publicly available in PDF format on the key comparison database platform (KCDB [3]). This database is continuously updated.

If you have any questions about this database, please contact romain.coulon@bipm.org.

## Structure of the data

### Root 

The root of the file consists of two sections. The first section gives general information on the data. The second section gives all available details on a given radionuclide.

* General information
  - Content
  - Date
  - References
* Name of the radionuclide (eg. Ga-67)
  - Key comparison data
  - Key comparison metadata

### Key comparison data

Each time a report is published, an entry is created such as "Key comparison BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ag-110m(YYYY)", where YYYY is the year of publication. The key comparison value (KCRV) is expressed as a string with the value followed by the standard uncertainty in brackets, then a space and finally the unit (e.g. "5980.8(64) kBq"). Values of the degrees of equivalence (DoE) are in number. The quantity $D_i$ is the value of the DoE and $U_i$ is the extended uncertainty ($k$=2). Please note that while the KCRV is reported for each reporting year, the degrees of equivalence are only available for publications after 2019. 

* Key comparison BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ag-110m(YYYY)
  - Name of the comparison

  - Unit
  - Degrees of Equivalence
    - Laboratory name
      - $D_i$
      - $U_i$
