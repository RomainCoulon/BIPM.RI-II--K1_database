# BIPM key comparison database for radionuclide metrology

This repository contains machine-readable versions (XML and JSON formats) of the BIPM/RI(II)-K1 key comparison reports [1].
These comparisons are made using the BIPM's measurement service, the International Reference System (SIR), which has been in use since 1976 [2].
The files contain exactly the same information as the reports publicly available in PDF format on the key comparison database platform (KCDB [3]).
